# AoC2022

This year in Scala

Will I break my negative record of last year and do even less than 3 days?

Lack of time is real

## Day 1

Easy once you chunk the input

I never remember how to functionally `chunkBy`

## Day 2

Still an easy-ish one, but I think it could be made better.

I like scoped-expression vals, very cool with the unzip I had to made
but probably a case class would have been better?

Domain modeling is okish, companion object is cool but type system
is better in F#
